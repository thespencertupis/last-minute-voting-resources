<p class="p noindent">At the time of writing this, it is 6 NOV 2018, and it&#39;s time to cast your ballot in the 2018 midterm elections.

<p class="p noindent">If you&#39;re anything like me, you&#39;ve been bombarded with political propoganda for months and don&#39;t know what to believe. Luckily, there are services out there that help cut through the smokescreens and allow you to see the truth in the claims politicians make.
</p><h4 id="sec-snopes" class="h3" data-heading-depth="3">Snopes</h4>
<p class="p noindent">One such service is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/" title="Snopes fact checking" data-linkid="snopes">Snopes</a>. Snopes allows you to fact-check news articles and popular social media posts and their dedicated researchers give the source a rating of reputability so you can more easily make a stance on the given information.
</p><h4 id="sec-ballotreadyorg" class="h3" data-heading-depth="3">BallotReady.org</h4>
<p class="p noindent">Snopes goes well together with&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotready.org/" title="Ballot Ready" data-linkid="ballot-ready">Ballot Ready</a>, which is the service I&#39;ve used to put together my ballot for this election. Ballot Ready lets you make an account, find your polling location, and research the values of the candidates. Afterwards, you choose whom you will vote for, and you can send the link to your phone for reference at the ballot.
